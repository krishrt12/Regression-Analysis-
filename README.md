This is a project I finished in the beginning of May-June 2021.

This Project has Exploratory Data Analysis in the beginning.
The next section contains a detailed study of the data using linear regression.
The next part contains algorithms such as KNN and Decision Trees.
Finally evaluation metrics to rank the models.
