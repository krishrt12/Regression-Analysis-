# Regression-Analysis-

This is a project I finished in the beginning of September 2020.

This Project has Exploratory Data Analysis in the beginning.

The next section contains a detailed study of the data using linear regression.

The next part contains algorithms such as KNN and Decision Trees.

Finally evaluation metrics to rank the models.
